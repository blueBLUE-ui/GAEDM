## introduction

A Novel Genetic Algorithm-Enhanced Model for Detecting API Hashing Obfuscation in Malware

## usage

##preprocess
We provide a example script to process the binary code. The script is located at `scripts/process.py`. You can use the script to process your own binaries.
```
/path/to/idat64 -c -A -S"scripts/process.py /path/to/binary_json"  /path/to/binary
```

##Model identification
```
python GAEDM/identify.py /path/to/binary_json
```


MalwareHash.txt is the sha256 hash list of the samples refered in paper
